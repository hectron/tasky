Acknowledgements:

First of all, I would like to thank JRupac for allowing me to contribute to his code. Without his basic foundation of this Google Tasks client, I would still be trying to print the code in a correct format.

Another person who deserves a lot of credit is my close friend, ProfOak. He was the reason that I started working in Python. Furthermore, he helped me understand how to create classes and troubleshoot "keys.py." Without his support and motivation, I might have ended up working on a Java version of this.

I also would like to thank my professor, George K. Thiruvathukal, for making me believe in myself. Even though I had little programming experience, his motivation led me to continue learning and hone my skills. I would also like to thank the Open Source community for making many things publicly available. The main things that come to mind are Python, Google Code, and the vast amount of tutorials found on the internet.
